# ping-exfil.sh
Just testing exfiltration through ping packets with bash. By no means anything complete, nor pretty nor expert level. Just some beginner's testing in bash.

#This test set was running on a private VM (sender) and AWS EC2 (receiver)

#Not safe at all, as you need access to ping on the sending side and tcpdump on the receiving end
